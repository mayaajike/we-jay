# We-Jay
 I will be creating an iOS mobile app called We-Jay that will help DJs and music fans connect at events. Music is a big part of any gathering, and while everyone wants to hear their favorite songs, DJs often have a hard time keeping the crowd interested, balancing requests, and managing requests.

For example, think about this situation: A group of Italian college graduates has their last dinner in France. The place, food, and service are all great, but the French DJ only plays French music. The Italian guests have a hard time enjoying the night because they can't understand the language and there isn't any music they can relate to. The end result is a celebration that is less meaningful and less memorable.

We-Jay addresses this. With the app, DJs can share a scannable code that connects guests to their playlist and through Apple Music or Spotify streaming accounts, guests can then:
[x] Submit song requests directly to the DJ’s playlist.
[x] Vote on other guests’ recommendations to help prioritize crowd favorites.
[x] Track when their requested songs are played.
[x] Rate the DJ’s performance at the end of the event.

On the DJ side, We-Jay provides organization and valuable insight. The app’s algorithms will rank songs by votes and requests, highlight crowd preferences, and generate a DJ score based on guest feedback and interactions. This ensures DJs can make informed decisions in real time, keeping the energy high and the audience satisfied.
Ultimately, We-Jay creates a more interactive, inclusive, and data-driven experience for both DJs and their audiences, transforming how music is shared and enjoyed at events.
